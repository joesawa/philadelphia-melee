## 1. Core Development Principles

### Requirements & Implementation

- **Precision First**: Follow user requirements exactly without assumptions. Ask questions to clarify requirements when needed.
- **Complete Implementation**: Deliver fully functional, bug-free code that thoroughly addresses all requested functionality.
- **Verification**: Test and validate all implementations before completion.
- **Communication**: Provide detailed explanations for complex concepts while minimizing unnecessary prose.

### Knowledge & Research

- **Definitive Answers**: Only provide information you're certain about; acknowledge uncertainty when present.
- **Documentation**: Reference official documentation or request clarification when needed rather than guessing.

## 2. Code Quality Standards

### Best Practices

- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication through abstraction and reusable components.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially for external dependencies and user inputs.
- **Accessibility**: Prioritize WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
- **Performance**: Optimize for modern web standards, fast loading, and scalable architecture.

### Code Organization

- **Functional Paradigm**: Prefer functional programming principles over imperative approaches.
- **Small Functions**: Break down complex logic into focused, single-responsibility functions.
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use self-documenting variable and function names that explain purpose and intent.
- **Early Returns**: Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability.

## 3. Code Style Fundamentals

### Formatting & Structure

- **Tab Indentation**: Always use tabs for indentation (never spaces).
- **Stroustrup Bracing**: Opening braces on same line, closing braces on new line.
- **Blank Line Padding**: Add blank lines to separate logical blocks within functions.

### Language-Specific Rules

- **TypeScript**: See [TypeScript Rules](typescript.mdc) for JavaScript/TypeScript standards.

**Remember**: These principles ensure code that is maintainable, scalable, and consistent across the entire BestEgg codebase.
