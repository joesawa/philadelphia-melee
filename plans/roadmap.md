# Roadmap

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure

-

I want to build a website for my local Super Smash Brothers Melee competitive scene.

We are in need of a central hub for content.

- Articles
- Upcoming tournaments
- General information about locations, contact, links.
- Current / previous power rankings
- In-region Slippi Leaderboard (Slippi is our netplay client)
- Twitch Live streams (possibly able to watch on the site, also includes local people to follow)
- Clean-but-subtle animations using a library like anime.js
- High SEO and performance focus.
- Admin login and dashboard for content management.

I am a WordPress dev by trade. I have PHPStan set to `max` level and have 0 ignored errors and no error baseline. My PHP is spotless. But I want to make a very clean, modern, fast, beautiful, lightweight and robustly secure website. And I don't think I want to use PHP anymore.

Important note: My backend development skills are very basic. I am a frontend developer. I am highly familiar with TypeScript, and Tailwind. I was originally a graphic designer, and I have a strong vision for how I want this site to look and feel.

I've been watching some youtube videos about Next.js, Convex, Payload CMS, and more and it sounds nice but I am not sure.

I tried setting up a site with Laravel + Filament + Vue 3 + Inertia.js, but immediately hit WAY too many problems, before I even started coding! Browsing that codebase, there seemed like too much magic and possible overkill. I might be looking for a TypeScript framework, but again, I am not sure.

- What frameworks would be good for a content-based site like this? One that doesn't expect too many visitors, but also doesn't expect more than 2-3 editors / administrators?
- Databases? Security? I need to make sure I can manage users and content securely.
- How will I edit content? Is Payload CMS a good option? What other options are there?
- How will I manage users who are able to edit content and post content/make changes/updates?
- What will I need to do to configure my local environment? What things will I need to get installed?
- How will I run my database and server locally with live/hot reloading?
- What do other developers go for in this situation? What are the best practices?

Please give me a very verbose response with a lot of considerations and thought. I will need a lot of handholding and explanation for backend related discussions. Please feel free to search the internet for answers and provide links to relevant resources.
